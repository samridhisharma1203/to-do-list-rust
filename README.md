# To-do-list-rust
This Rust project is a simple console-based to-do list application designed for ease of use and task management. Users can interact with the application by adding tasks, marking them as completed, and viewing the current task list in real-time.

# Features:
Add Tasks: Users can add multiple tasks by specifying the number of tasks they want to add and providing individual task descriptions.
Complete Tasks: Users can mark tasks as completed, removing them from the active task list.
Dynamic Task List: The application dynamically displays the current task list, making it easy for users to track their to-do items.

Complete Task: Choose the 'Complete Task' option, and the application will guide you through marking a task as completed.
